# Abstract of the Thesis 

This dissertation examines the application of choreography principles in industrial automation to increase the flexibility, adaptability, and reusability of modular production systems.

The starting point is the observation that the Process Orchestration Layer is increasingly reaching its limits. Engineering efforts are rising and latency times in cross-module information processing are reaching critical levels.

Following a design science research process, requirements are systematically derived from practical application scenarios. These are incorporated into a framework for implementing automation service choreographies. The framework includes architecture and design patterns for the distributed, configurable interaction of automation services. Standards such as OPC UA and the MTP concept are used to ensure manufacturer neutrality.

The developed artifacts are aimed for system and software architects as well as PLC programmers. They support the planning and implementation of modular production systems with automation service choreographies and help to close the gap between theory and practice.

Its practical suitability has been proven through implementations on established control platforms (SIMATIC TIA Portal, TwinCAT 3) and through industrial experiments with partners Merck, BASF, and Siemens. Engineering efforts can be significantly reduced by shifting tasks to the module level. Direct communication between controllers enables minimal latency times.

In summary, this work makes a well-founded and practical contribution to the further development of modular production systems with the aim of further increasing flexibility, adaptability, and reusability.
