## :zero: Introduction

Welcome to my Github repository about Automation Service Choreography.
The work presented in this repository is derived from my ongoing PhD research.
In accordance with my progress I will update this repository with my latest findings and insights from my research.

My name is [Andreas Stutz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas-Stutz), I am a research engineer at Siemens in Karlsruhe. Besides this job I am doing my PhD at the Institute of Automation Technology at Helmuth Schmidt University / University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg under [Prof. Alexander Fay](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Fay).

My co-supervisor is [Prof. Mike Barth](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike-Barth) from the Institute for Smart Systems and Services at the University of Applied Sciences Pforzheim.

## :one: Research Area

In my research, I am concerned with adapting the idea of service choreographies in the context of industrial automation systems. Service choreography is a second association mechanism in the web service domain in addition to orchestration.

The idea of transferring service choreographies into the domain of industrial automation is the starting point of this work. The goal is to develop and evaluate an adaptive runtime architecture based on a collaborative approach between commercial automation systems.

The scope of my research is initially focused on the process industry and the ongoing activities in this area with regard to the topic of modular production. Requirements for the solution to be developed come from standardization committees, publicly and privately funded research projects as well as expert interviews with users of automation in the process industry.
